# UI Components and Design System

## Design Principles

- **Internal & Information-First**: Built for an internal user, designed to surface clear, utilitarian information
- **Desktop-First**: Optimized for laptop/monitor usage (1280–1440px wide)
- **Visual Clarity**: Clean, grid-based layout with high white space and minimal chrome
- **Mood**: Calm, analytical, and elegant — no unnecessary flair, drama, or playfulness
- **Imagery-Centric**: Clothing items displayed prominently in structured, framed cards
- **Component Library**: Always use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components where applicable to maintain visual and functional consistency

## Layout System

- **Container Max Width**: 1200px centered with 64px side padding
- **Layout**: Two-column grid on wide screens; stack on narrow
- **Spacing Scale**: 8px base (16, 24, 32, 40, 64px increments)
- **Rounded Corners**: 6px for most elements, square or 4px for framed cards
- **No Shadows**: Avoid drop shadows — rely on spacing and contrast for separation

## Key Pages Design

### /today (Outfit Dashboard)

**Layout:**

- Two-column layout:
  - **Left:** Full outfit recommendation (shirt, pants, shoes, etc.) in stacked image cards
  - **Right:** Context panel (e.g. weather, recency, variants)

**Outfit Item Cards:**

- Image centered in a dark frame (`#1A1A1A`) on white background
- Frame thickness: 2–3px
- Image padding: 24px inside the frame
- Text label below: Item name in small neutral font (14–16px)
- No shadows, no hover animations beyond maybe subtle underline or opacity change

### /history (Outfit Log)

- Simple vertical list or grid of past outfits
- Each card = full outfit thumbnail, date, short context

### /inventory (Clothing Index)

- Filterable grid of all owned clothing items
- Tags for category, season, recency

## Component Patterns

### Cards

- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`
- **Frame Border:** Solid dark gray `#1A1A1A`
- **Padding:** 24px min inside card
- **Radius:** 6px (or square if better visually)
- **Shadow:** None

### Buttons

- **Primary:** Ghost style, outline only (`#1A1A1A`), 8px radius
- **Hover State:** Background `rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`
- **Typography:** 16px Inter, medium weight
- **Padding:** 12px vertical, 24px horizontal

### Typography

- **Font:** Inter, sans-serif system font stack fallback
- **Hierarchy:**
  - H1: 32px, regular
  - H2: 24px, regular
  - H3: 18px, medium
  - Body: 16px
  - Label/Meta: 13–14px, light
- **Tone:** Analytical, quiet — no dramatic weights or italics

## Color Palette

- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`
- **Primary Text:** `#1A1A1A`
- **Secondary Text:** `#6B7280`
- **Frame Border:** `#1A1A1A`
- **Muted UI Elements:** `#C0C0C0` to `#DADADA`
- **Hover Fill:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)`

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile/tablet fallback:** Secondary concern
- **Breakpoints:** 1440px, 1024px, 768px
- **Stack layout:** Collapse to single-column with consistent vertical spacing

## Moodboard

- **Aesthetic Reference:** Fetchr-style minimalism (dark frames, white backgrounds, strong vertical rhythm)
- **Philosophy:** If this were a zine or index catalog, it would be clean, sharp, and easy to flip through
- **Not:** Playful, trendy, or consumer-facing

## Accessibility & Performance

- High contrast text and components
- No dynamic animations
- Immediate updates on action (e.g. outfit change triggers re-render, no confirmation needed)
- Full keyboard accessibility where applicable

## Summary

This is a minimalist internal tool designed for confident, clean daily use. Every interaction is intentional, every component serves clarity. It’s a wardrobe control panel — not a stylist, not a shopping app.
